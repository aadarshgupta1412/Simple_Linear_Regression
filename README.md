# Simple_Linear_Regression

AUTHOR : Aadarsh Gupta

# Introduction

The software aims to predict the ideal salary for a candidate with experience (in floating value of years) based on given data of salary of 30 existing candidates and corrsponding experience. The software is trained as a simple linear regression model, with 70% of the data points taken for training data and rest 30% of data points for testing purposes.

# Packages Used
The following packages have been used while training of the model and visualization puposes :
- numpy : for linear algebra operations
- pandas : for data processing operations I/O in CSV file
- matplotlib : for visualizing the results
- sklearn : for data split, Linear Regression model and MSE (mean squared error)

# Requirements
